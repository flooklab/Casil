 * \brief Hardware layer: Drivers that control the connected devices/components.
 *
 * This is the second layer, which provides Driver components as the next higher-level abstraction
 * as compared to the interfaces in the transfer layer (TL). The drivers define and abstract protocols
 * needed for actually \e controlling the devices/components that are connected via the transfer layer.
 *
 * The drivers do not deal with the details of the transmission of those protocols, which is already taken care of by TL.
 * The idea is that the protocols can in principle be sent over any configured interface component, at least if the used
 * hardware can be connected to the host via different interfaces and no "special" functionality is needed. Another (obvious)
 * contraint is that only "direct"/"muxed" interfaces can be used for "direct"/"muxed" drivers (see Driver and TL::Interface).
 *
 * An even higher level abstraction is available for e.g. "muxed" drivers that expose access to \e hardware \e registers
 * of the respective firmware modules or any drivers that provide other functionality that can be operated on as if it
 * was a hardware register. This abstraction for individual such registers is provided by the register layer (RL).
 *
 * Note that hardware register access is also possible from the hardware layer using "register drivers" (see RegisterDriver).

/*!
 * \brief Common base class for all driver components in the hardware layer (HL).
 *
 * This class provides very basic/limited functionality likely common to all drivers.
 * It is not intended to directly derive drivers from this class.
 *
 * Because of the \e direct/muxed interface split in the \ref Layers::TL "TL", drivers must be split into two such groups as well:
 * - "Direct" drivers: Drivers for independent/stand-alone hardware (not using the basil bus)
 * - "Muxed" drivers: Drivers for firmware modules running on FPGA hardware based on the basil bus
 *
 * Hence use either DirectDriver for implementing a \e direct driver or MuxedDriver
 * (or its RegisterDriver specialization) for implementing a \e muxed driver.
