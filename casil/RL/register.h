 * \brief %Register layer: Abstraction for register(-like) functionalities of the drivers.
 *
 * This is the third layer with the most high-level abstraction, which provides advanced possibilities to access hardware
 * registers of firmware modules, to use special driver functionality as if it was a simple register or to simplify using
 * driver functionality in other ways (e.g. automatically binding certain function arguments such as device channel numbers).
 *
 * \todo The last aspect would be a "FunctionalRegister" as in basil; not implemented and not sure if this will
 *       ever be implemented \e directly in the C++ library in a satisfying way (maybe just too pythonic)
 *       --> i.e. need to perhaps revisit this description at some point
 *
 * To accomplish that a Register uses the HL::Driver API from the hardware layer (HL). Note, though,
 * that the interchangeability of the driver components to be used for the register components is \e less
 * than between drivers (HL) and interfaces (TL), simply because of the higher specialization/abstraction
 * of the hardware layer with respect to the transfer layer. Using an arbitrary driver for a specific
 * register does not \e necessarily crash but often just does not make any sense.
 *
 * Note that a different way of register access is also available \e directly in the hardware layer by using "register drivers"
 * (see RegisterDriver). The register layer is not a substitute for that and should rather be used in a complementary way.
